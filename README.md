how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment:

## Self-Reflection:
I was trying to do the npm install http-server but it seemed to do nothing. I also tried to use the Web Server Chrome extension and it also did not do anything. I couldn't select a folder it just would sit there. Some of it seems to not work. The game probably won't work after this commit but maybe once the grading is it might work. Even though I don't think it will. 
### How long it took me to finish this?
